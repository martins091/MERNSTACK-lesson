<!-- What is HTML?
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and 
structure content on the web. It provides the structure for web pages by using a 
series of elements, also known as tags, which define the different parts of a web page, 
such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

What Does HTML Do?
HTML allows you to:
Organize content: Use headings, paragraphs, and lists to create a logical structure.
Add multimedia: Incorporate images, videos, and audio.
Link web pages: Create hyperlinks to navigate between pages.
Create forms: Collect user input using text fields, buttons, checkboxes, and more.
The Structure of an HTML Document
A basic HTML document has a structured layout with several important elements:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the type of document and version of HTML being used.
<html>: The root element that contains all the content of the page.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, such as its title, character set, and links to stylesheets.
<title>: Specifies the title of the page, which appears in the browserâ€™s title bar or tab.
<body>: Contains the content that is displayed on the web page, such as text, images, and links.
Basic HTML Syntax
Each HTML element consists of:

Opening tag: <tagname>, which marks the beginning of the element.
Content: The content inside the element.
Closing tag: </tagname>, which marks the end of the element. -->

<!-- Example of an HTML element: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Introduction to HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph in HTML. HTML stands for <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong> 
        and is used to create web pages.</p>
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image" width="300" />
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>

<!-- 
    <!DOCTYPE html>: This tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
<html lang="en">: The <html> tag is the root of the HTML document, and lang="en" 
    specifies that the language of the document is English.
<head>: Contains metadata, such as the character set and the title.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Ensures that the webpage uses the UTF-8 character set, which 
    supports most characters.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: 
    Makes the webpage responsive on different devices.
<title>: Sets the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser tab.
<body>: The main content of the webpage.
