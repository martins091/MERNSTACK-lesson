<!-- Both <div> and <span> are container tags in HTML that are used to group elements together, 
    but they serve different purposes: <div> Tag
    The <div> tag (short for "division") is a block-level element used to group larger 
    sections of content or elements. It takes up the full width available, creating a new 
    line before and after the element. Often used as a container for other HTML elements 
    to apply styles or structure the page layout. -->

<div>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Martins, and I am a web developer. I enjoy creating beautiful and functional websites.</p>
</div>

<!-- In this example, the <div> tag wraps the heading and paragraph, making it easy to apply 
      styles and structure them together. -->

<!-- <span> Tag
        The <span> tag is an inline element used to group smaller pieces of text or other 
        inline elements.  It does not create a new line before or after it, 
        making it perfect for styling a part of a sentence or text within a paragraph.
