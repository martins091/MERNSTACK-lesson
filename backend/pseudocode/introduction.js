// Pseudocode
// This is a way to describe the logic of an algorithm using a mixture of plain language and
// some programming like structure without focusing on the syntax of any particular programming
// language. It allows developers to plan or explain algorithms without worrying about specific
// code rules, making it easier to understand.
